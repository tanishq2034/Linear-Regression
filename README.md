# Linear-Regression
### Linear Regression

A simple implementation of linear regression using Python that is built entirely from scratch without using machine learning libraries. This project demonstrates the core concepts of linear regression, including:

* Reading and processing CSV data
* Implementing the least squares method
* Visualizing results using `matplotlib`
* Understanding relationships between features (e.g., study time vs. score)


(although i did not use the 'loss function' but we can use this for many different visualisations)
